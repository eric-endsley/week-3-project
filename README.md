# Beep-Boop Machine

#### A machine that returns a patterned series of beeps, boops and 'welcome to the neighborhood's, 11/4/20

#### By Eric Endsley

## Description
This webpage consists of a single input form which prompts the user to enter a number, and a submit button. The number inputted by the user determines the length of an array, which is then displayed to the user as a string of terms, in a specific pattern, separated by commas. The terms in the string are patterned as follows: 1. All terms in the string which don't follow any other rule display as the number corresponding to their position in the string (e.g. the 4th term is 4) 2. All terms whose position in the string contains a 3 will display as "Won't you be my neighbor?" (e.g. the 30th term is "Won't you be my neighbor?"). All terms whose position in the string contains a 2 AND do not contiain a 3 will display as "Boop" (e.g. the 12th term is "Boop"). Lastly a term whose position in the string contain a 1 but NOT a 2 or 3 will dipslay as "Beep" (e.g. the 14th term is "Beep").
